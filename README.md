## Scala-Play - Database CRUD & Query Pagination

---

The Git repo contains source code of a Scala application using the Play framework.  It's primarily a programming exercise for understanding how a simple web-based database CRUD application can be built using Scala, Play and Anorm.  The application expands from an existing TypeSafe template that illustates database CRUD and query pagination with the following changes:

1. Expand the schema with multiple relational entities
2. Apply Anorm's parsing, filtering and query pagination to multiple views
3. Modularize controller code into multiple controllers
4. Add a navigation bar with some simple Bootstrap UI enhancement

##### To run the application, simply proceed as follows:

1. Git-clone the repo to a local disk
2. Run './activator ui' from within the project root (Activator's UI will be fired off in a web browser)
3. Click 'compile', then 'run' from within the Activator's UI
4. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:9000/
